# Multi-label Text Classification Evaluation with Transformer Models

This repository contains code for evaluating a multi-label text classification model using Transformer models, specifically the `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions` model, on the [GoEmotions](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions) dataset.

## Overview

The evaluation process involves the following steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Load the GoEmotions dataset, specifically the test split, for evaluation.
2. **Running the Model**: Load the pre-trained Transformer model and run it on the test split of the dataset.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) both overall and per label.
4. **Threshold Optimization**: Search for the optimal threshold for converting model probabilities to binary predictions, maximizing the F1-score.
5. **Results Visualization**: Visualize the evaluation results using matplotlib and streamlit.

## Files

- `main.py`: Streamlit web application for visualizing the evaluation results.
- `evaluation.py`: Python script containing the evaluation code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `model_evaluation_results.pickle`: Pickle file containing serialized evaluation results.
- `README.md`: Markdown file providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git lfs clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-label-text-classification-evaluation.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. Explore the evaluation results using the web interface.
